## Fastladder

[Fastladder](https://github.com/fastladder/fastladder) is an innovative RSS reader in a meaning that divides the browsing into two simpler tasks, feed browsing and article reading.
For example, in a usual RSS reader, you would see list of the updated feeds you subscribe to.
Then you dig in the unread articles in a feed, back to the feed list, and iterate them again and again.
On the other hand, [Fastladder](https://github.com/fastladder/fastladder) separates reading each article from the whole task.
It allows you to first focus on <em>pinning</em> the articles you will read.
Later, you just read the <em>pinned</em> articles at once without any task interference.
Besides, the vim-like intuitive key bindings help you get the task done more quickly and less stressfully.
